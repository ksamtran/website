<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying for your commissioned piece.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>1. GENERAL TERMS</h2>
<p>All drawings will include a subtle signature that you may not remove.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I might record the drawing process and post it on my youtube.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Prices are subject to change based on demand.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have the right to reject any order that I do not feel comfortable drawing for any reason.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>2. PAYMENT</h2>
<p>Currency accepted is GBP and USD and can be paid through PayPal or bank transfer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commissions can be paid either 100% upfront or split 50% upfront and 50% after sketch approval.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't send me any payment before I have agreed to give you a slot and requested you to send me the payment.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3. PROCESS AND DELIVERY</h2>
<p>I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund (see point 7 further below for more info on refunds)
<br>
<br>
<br>
While I'm working on your commission I will make reviews with you to make sure I make it just right for you!
<br>
<br>
<br>
The amount of reviews depends on the complexity of the work.
<br>
<br>
<br>
During the reviews, you will see work-in-progress and these images will usually include a watermark and be smaller than the finished piece.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The time it takes to finish your commission varies 1 week - 3 months depending on factors such as health, the complexity of the commissioned piece, other work and con seasons.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time I will let you know asap.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once the piece is finished you will receive the full-resolution image along with a web-friendly size. Note that there is no physical product. Depending on where you live, we can arrange to print your artwork. Just ask :) </p>
​<br>
<br>
<h2>4. REVISIONS</h2>
<p>A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing - unless, of course, a misunderstanding from my side has been made.
<br>
​<br>
<br>
If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make and is usually based on an hourly wage.
<br>
​<br>
<br>
If your reference is unclear to start with changes will come at an extra charge.</p>
<br>
​<br>
<h2>5. COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY</h2>
<p>I, Sam Tran (the artist), claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:
<br>
​<br>
Promote myself with it everywhere
<br>
​<br>
Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)
<br>
​<br>
Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)
<br>
​<br>
Post it wherever I want</p>
<br>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">The buyer is allowed to:</h4>
<p>Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)
<br>
​<br>
Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself.
<br>
​<br>
Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.
<br>
​<br>
Use the artwork on their Youtube channel and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.</p>
<br>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">The following is considered copyright infringement:</h4>
<p>Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.
<br>
<br>
Claiming the artwork as your own
<br>
<br>
Removing my signature from the Artwork
<br>
<br>
Altering the artwork without my consent
<br>
<br>
<br>
I reserve the full rights to the image and it's use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time).</p>
​<br>
<br>
<h2>6. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</h2>
<p>I will do everything I can to make my customers happy!
<br>
​<br>
<br>
If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.
<br>
​<br>
<br>
I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.</p>
​<br>
<br>
<h2>7. REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
<p>The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.
<br>
​<br>
<br>
If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.
<br>
​<br>
<br>
If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.
<br>
​<br>
<br>
If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.
<br>
​<br>
<br>
If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a refund you will lose all beforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talk about the commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for commissioning me again.
<br>
<br>
​<br>
If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Sam Tran (the artist), and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.</p>
​<br>
<br>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">What do you get?</h4>
<p>Drafts/mockups that you must decide which one I should continue with (depending on the complexity of the commission there might be fewer or more drafts)
<br>
​<br>
<br>
Sketch and/or final sketches that you must accept before I continue the work
<br>
​<br>
<br>
Insight and involvement in color plan (depending on the complexity of the commissioned piece)
<br>
​<br>
<br>
Full-resolution file (approx. 210 x 297 mm at 300 DPI) of final drawing and a smaller version for internet upload. Final file formats are usually PNG.</p>
