<h3>If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying for your commissioned piece.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>1. GENERAL TERMS</h2>
<h3>All drawings will include a subtle signature that you may not remove.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>I might record the drawing process and post it on my youtube.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Prices are subject to change based on demand.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>I have the right to reject any order that I do not feel comfortable drawing for any reason.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>2. PAYMENT</h2>
<h3>Currency accepted is GBP and USD and can be paid through PayPal or bank transfer. </h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Commissions can be paid either 100% upfront or split 50% upfront and 50% after sketch approval.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Don't send me any payment before I have agreed to give you a slot and requested you to send me the payment.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3. PROCESS AND DELIVERY</h2>
<h3>I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund (see point 7 further below for more info on refunds)</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>While I'm working on your commission I will make reviews with you to make sure I make it just right for you!</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The amount of reviews depends on the complexity of the work.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>During the reviews, you will see work-in-progress and these images will usually include a watermark and be smaller than the finished piece.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The time it takes to finish your commission varies 1 week - 3 months depending on factors such as health, the complexity of the commissioned piece, other work and con seasons.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time I will let you know asap.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Once the piece is finished you will receive the full-resolution image along with a web-friendly size. Note that there is no physical product. Depending on where you live, we can arrange to print your artwork. Just ask :)</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
​<br>
<br>
<h2>4. REVISIONS</h2>
<h3>A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing - unless, of course, a misunderstanding from my side has been made.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make and is usually based on an hourly wage.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If your reference is unclear to start with changes will come at an extra charge.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
​<br>
<h2>5. COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY</h2>
<h3>I, Sam Tran (the artist), claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:</h3>
<br>
<h3>Promote myself with it everywhere</h3>
<br>
<h3>Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)</h3>
<br>
<h3>Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)</h3>
<br>
<h3>Post it wherever I want</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The buyer is allowed to:</h3>
<br>
<h3>Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)</h3>
<br>
<h3>Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Use the artwork on their Youtube channel and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The following is considered copyright infringement:</h3>
<br>
<h3>Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Claiming the artwork as your own</h3>
<br>
<h3>Removing my signature from the artwork</h3>
<br>
<h3>Altering the artwork without my consent</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>I reserve the full rights to the image and it's use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time).</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
​<br>
<br>
<h2>6. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</h2>
<h3>I will do everything I can to make my customers happy!</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
​<br>
<br>
<h2>7. REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
<h3>The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a refund you will lose all beforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talk about the commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for commissioning me again.</h3>
<br>
​<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Sam Tran (the artist), and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.</h3>
<br>
​<br>
<br>
​<br>
<br>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<h3>Drafts/mockups that you must decide which one I should continue with (depending on the complexity of the commission there might be fewer or more drafts)</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Sketch and/or final sketches that you must accept before I continue the work</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Insight and involvement in color plan (depending on the complexity of the commissioned piece)</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Full-resolution file (approx. 210 x 297 mm at 300 DPI) of final drawing and a smaller version for internet upload. Final file formats are usually PNG.</h3>
